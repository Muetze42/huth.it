<h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
<p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a
    TLS encryption program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by
    the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.</p>
<p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

    contract with us, this information is required to process payments.</p>
<p>Payment transactions using common modes of paying (Visa/MasterCard, debit to your bank account) are processed exclusively via encrypted SSL or TLS connections. You can recognize an encrypted
    connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser
    line.</p>
<p>If the communication with us is encrypted, third parties will not be able to read the payment information you share with us.</p>

<h2>6. Online marketing and partner programs</h2>
<h3>Affiliate Programs on this website</h3>
<p>We participate in affiliate partner programs. In conjunction with affiliate partner programs, ads of businesses (advertisers) are placed on websites of other enterprises within the affiliate
    partner network (publisher). If you click on one of these affiliate ads, you will be transferred to the promoted offer. If you should subsequently engage in a certain transaction (conversion),
    the publisher will receive a respective commission in exchange for the service. To be able to compute the commission amount, the affiliate network operator must be in a position to track the
    ad that has resulted in you seeing the offer and in you completing the predefined transaction. To make this possible, cookies or comparable recognition technologies are deployed (e.g., device
    fingerprinting).</p>
<p>Data is stored and analyzed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the correct computation of its affiliate compensation. If appropriate consent
    has been obtained, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and &sect; 25 (1) TTDSG, insofar the consent includes the storage of cookies or the access to
    information in the user&rsquo;s end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TTDSG. This consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p>We participate in the following affiliate programs:</p>
<h4>eRecht24 affiliate program</h4>
<p>The operator of the affiliate network is the eRecht24 GmbH &amp; Co KG, Lietzenburger Str. 94, 10719 Berlin. When you click on an eRecht24 affiliate link, you will first be forwarded to the
    payment service provider Digistore24 (Digistore24 GmbH, St.-Godehard-Stra&szlig;e 32 in 31139 Hildesheim), which uses recognition technology (e.g., cookies) to record that you have been
    directed to the eRecht24 services via our website. This is done for the purpose of billing the affiliate commission.</p>
